Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is the standard for describing data structures in telecommunication and computer networking world. ASN.1 provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects. The specification describes abstract objects that are independent of machine-specific encoding techniques.

ASN defined data can be encoded using one of these encoding rules:

  * Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
  * Canonical Encoding Rules (CER)
  * Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
  * XML Encoding Rules (XER)
  * Packed Encoding Rules (PER)
  * Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER)


ASN.1, together with specific ASN.1 encoding rules, facilitates the exchange of structured data between application programs over networks by describing data structures in a way that is independent of machine architecture and implementation language.

Mobicents ASN Library has been designed as a simple library that enables the user to encode and decode streams according to ASN rules. It provides the user with the tools to process primitives and build more complex objects as defined in ASN.
